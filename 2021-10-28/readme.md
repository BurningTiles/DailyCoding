# Ransom Note

This problem was recently asked by Google:

A criminal is constructing a ransom note. In order to disguise his handwriting, he is cutting out letters from a magazine.

Given a magazine of letters and the note he wants to write, determine whether he can construct the word.

```python
def canSpell(magazine, note):
  # Fill this in.
    
print(canSpell(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'], 'bed'))
# True

print(canSpell(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'], 'cat'))
# False
```
