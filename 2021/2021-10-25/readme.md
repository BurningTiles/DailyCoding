# ZigZag Conversion

The string should be written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows. Then read it line by line.

```
Ex: s="INSTAGRAMISAWESOME", rows=4
I     R     W
N   G A   A E  E
S A   M S   S M 
T     I     O

Now read line by line: "IRWNGAAEESAMSSMTIO"
```

Here's an example and some starter code.

```python
def zigzag(s, rows):
  # your code here
print(zigzag("INSTAGRAMISAWESOME", 4))
```
