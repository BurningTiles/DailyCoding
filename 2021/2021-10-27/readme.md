# Autocompletion

This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:

Implement auto-completion. Given a large set of words (for instance 1,000,000 words) and then a single word prefix, find all words that it can complete to.

```python
class Solution:
  def build(self):
    # Fill this in.
    
  def autocomplete(self, word):
    # Fill this in.

s = Solution()
s.build(['dog', 'dark', 'cat', 'door', 'dodge'])
print(s.autocomplete('do'))
# ["dodge", "dog", "door"]
```
