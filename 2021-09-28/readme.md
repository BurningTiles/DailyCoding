# Minimum Number of Operations

You are only allowed to perform 2 operations, multiply a number by 2, or subtract a number by 1. Given a number x and a number y, find the minimum number of operations needed to go from x to y. Assume that y will be positive integer.

Here's an example and some starter code.

```python
def min_operations(x, y):
  # Fill this in.

print(min_operations(6, 20))
# (((6 - 1) * 2) * 2) = 20 : 3 operations needed only
# print 3

print(min_operations(20, 25))
# print 9

print(min_operations(7, 65))
# print 10
```
